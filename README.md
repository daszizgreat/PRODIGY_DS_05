Title:
Analyzing Traffic Accident Data: Identifying Patterns and Visualizing Hotspots

Description:
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data to unveil patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The primary goal was to identify key factors contributing to accidents and visualize accident hotspots for informed decision-making.

Through meticulous data processing and analysis, I systematically examined various parameters such as road conditions, weather conditions, and time stamps associated with each accident record. By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, I discerned patterns and correlations among these variables.

Utilizing geospatial analysis tools, I mapped out accident locations to visualize hotspots and areas with higher incident rates. By overlaying additional contextual information such as road infrastructure and traffic density, I provided deeper insights into accident-prone zones.
